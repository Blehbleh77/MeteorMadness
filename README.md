## üöÄChallenge Overview



**Event:** 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge



**Difficulty:** Beginner/Youth, Intermediate, Advanced



**Subjects:** Astrophysics, Coding, Data Analysis, Disaster Response, Space Exploration, Statistics



NASA‚Äôs challenge:

> A newly identified near-Earth asteroid, *Impactor-2025*, poses a potential threat to Earth. Develop an interactive visualization and simulation tool that integrates NASA and USGS datasets, allowing users to model asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and explore mitigation strategies.



Our solution: **Meteor Madness** ‚Äì an engaging, educational, and scientifically informed platform to explore asteroid impacts and defend Earth in real-time.
