## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python (3.11 or newer)** installed: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
  Make sure to check **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** during installation.  
- **pip** (comes with Python, installed with Python)  
- **Optional but recommended:** a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts

### **Step 1: Get the Project Files**

You can get the files in **two ways**: using Git or a ZIP download.

#### **Option A: Download ZIP (No Git Needed)**

1. Go to the GitHub repository: [Meteor Madness](https://github.com/Blehbleh77/Meteor_Madness)  
2. Click the **Code** button (green) ‚Üí Select **Download ZIP**.  
3. Save the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., `Downloads`).  
4. **Extract the ZIP**:  
   - **Windows:** Right-click ‚Üí Extract All ‚Üí Choose a folder (e.g., `C:\Meteor_Madness`)  
   - **macOS:** Double-click the ZIP ‚Üí It creates a folder with the project files  
   - **Linux:** Right-click ‚Üí Extract Here, or use `unzip Meteor_Madness.zip` in terminal  
5. Open the folder containing the extracted files. You should see files like `main_menu.py`, `game_mode.py`, `exploration_mode.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the `assets` folder.

#### **Option B: Use Git (If Installed)**

If you have Git installed, open a terminal / command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blehbleh77/Meteor_Madness.git
cd Meteor_Madness
```


### **Step 2: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Step 3: Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 4: Run the Streamlit main menu:**


```bash
streamlit run main_menu.py
```
