## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python (3.10 or 3.11)** installed: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
  Make sure to check **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** during installation.  
- **pip** (comes with Python, installed with Python)  
- **Optional but recommended:** a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts

---

### **Step 1: Get the Project Files**

You can get the files in **two ways**: using Git or a ZIP download.

#### **Option A: Download ZIP (No Git Needed)**

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click the **Code** button (green) ‚Üí Select **Download ZIP**.  
3. Save the ZIP file to a folder on your computer .
4. **Extract the ZIP**:  
   - **Windows:** Right-click ‚Üí Extract All ‚Üí Choose a folder 
   - **macOS:** Double-click the ZIP ‚Üí It creates a folder with the project files  
   - **Linux:** Right-click ‚Üí Extract Here, or use `unzip Meteor_Madness.zip` in terminal  


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** After extraction, you might see a folder inside another folder like  
`Meteor_Madness-main/Meteor_Madness-main/`  
Make sure you open the *inner* folder ‚Äî the one that contains files like:  
`main_menu.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the `assets` folder.




#### **Option B: Use Git (If Installed)**

If you have Git installed, open a terminal / command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blehbleh77/Meteor_Madness.git
cd Meteor_Madness
```


### **Step 2: Install Required Packages**

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Change directory to the folder with the requirements.txt file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Run the Streamlit main menu:**

Run this command in the same terminal:

```bash
python -m streamlit run main_menu.py
```

If that doesn‚Äôt work, try this alternative:

```bash
python -m streamlit run main_menu.py
```
